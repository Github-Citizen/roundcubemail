#     Do NOT change the label text inside the [ brackets ].
#     When translating keep the '#' symbol in the sentence and it will be
#     converted to the number of days set in the config.inc.php file.

#     For example in English: 'Stay logged in for # days'

$labels['Stay logged in'] = 'Stay logged in for # days';
